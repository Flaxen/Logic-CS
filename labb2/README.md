Checks if proofs for Natural Deduction are correct or not

For running tests run:
$ ./testRunner.bash

This will run tests for all .txt files located in tests/ and state that the file has 'passed' if it got expected results and 'failed' if it got unexpected results. This means that if an invalid test fails the test will state 'passed'.
